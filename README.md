# Web-Server

## :clipboard: Introduction

Simple system of a multithreaded web server with version 1.0 of HTTP (RFC 1945), which allows you to make HTTP requests to the server.

## :bar_chart: Operation

The system allows the user to access files through HTTP requests, which can be made using a web browser, as shown in the example below.



## :heavy_exclamation_mark: Observations

* In the project, the files to be requested are found inside the "resources" folder.

* The port used was port 1998.

~~~ Java
int port = 1998;
~~~

## :question: How to test 

To test the program, just download this repository and run the program, thus leaving the web server online. From this, it is already possible to make HTTP requests of the files contained in the resources folder.
